- Uses the [Teller API](https://teller.io/) to retrieve new settled transactions in my checking account daily
	- I scheduled the code to execute daily on a Google Cloud Functions cron job
- Each transaction is then uploaded to notion through the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/), where I can add further customizations and track the progress of my budget throughout the month
    - The software automatically assigns an emoji to each transaction based on the category given by Teller.
