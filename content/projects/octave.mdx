- *Note: Octave does not actually play music, only silent audio with the same length as the song*

## Problems Faced

### Hosting on firebase using Next.js 14
- Every time I navigated using `<Link>` there would be a full page reload
- This behavior reset the app state between pages
	- Caused the app to completely forget the currently playing song, and had to re-fetch the authentication state
	- Solution: force-dynamic on the root route:
```typescript
//	app/layout.tsx

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"
```

## Additional Info
- Cached track metadata on browser using localstorage
- Recently migrated the project to typescript when I migrated to Next.js
